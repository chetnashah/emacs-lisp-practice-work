#lang racket

;; By using define-syntax we are making a transformer binding.
;; Effectively telling Racket compiler, whenever encounterirng a chunk of syntax starting with foo
;; give it to transformer function specified and replace it with syntax returned from the transformer

(define-syntax foo
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax "doo doo")))

;; similar to define and lambda, one can use shorthand at binding

(define-syntax (foo2 stx)
  (syntax "woo hoo"))
