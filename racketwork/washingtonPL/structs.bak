;; racket struct help generate tagged bag of fields (like ML constructors)
;; help you introduce a cartesian product of values, with a tagname

(struct posn (x y) #:transparent) ;; posn is struct-name and x, y are its fields
(struct posn2 [x y] #:transparent) ;; also a valid syntax

;; defining struct introduces following functions
;; 1. struct constructor to make new values of struct
(define point1 (posn 2 3))

;; 2. struct predicate, to check if given value confirms to a struct
(posn? point1)
(posn? 11)

;; 3. field accessors for each field in struct
(posn-x point1)
(posn-y point1)
